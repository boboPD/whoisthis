	<p class="block_">His brother and sisters gave a sigh of relief. Billy was safe for the moment. He wouldn’t starve because Mama and Papa would find him and feed him on the ground. But the ground was still a very dangerous place and it would be some time before Billy could fly.</p>
	<p class="block_">Then the miracle happened. On the other side of the open space beside the great oak tree, an old man had been resting on a park bench. When he saw the robins attack the cat, he knew that they must be protecting one of their babies.</p>
	<p class="block_">The kind old man rose from his bench and strolled over to the oak tree. It didn’t take him long to spot Billy hiding in the grass. </p>
