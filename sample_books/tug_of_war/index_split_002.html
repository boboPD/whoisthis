	<p class="block_">One of the first lessons of life that all these little baby robins needed to learn was to have better manners. They often fought among themselves over who would get the best or the most food, and they never said “thank you” to Papa or Mama Robin, who worked very hard to find food for all of them. No matter how much their parents talked to them and tried to help them get along, they were becoming quite naughty little birds, quarreling and teasing, and pushing and shoving much of the time. Then one day something happened that changed all that.</p>
