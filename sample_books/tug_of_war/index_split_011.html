	<p class="block_">That is when the great tug of war began. Billy grabbed one end of the worm and Chirpy, Cherry and Reddy grabbed the other end and started pulling. Billy was big, but he was no match for his three siblings all pulling against him. Billy decided to climb up on the edge of the nest to get better footing and yank the worm away from the rest of them.</p>
