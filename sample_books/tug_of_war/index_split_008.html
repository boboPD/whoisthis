	<p class="block_">“Oh look! Papa found my worm!” Billy chirped. “It looks like I’m going to get my breakfast first!” Billy opened his very large mouth expecting Papa to drop the whole worm in.</p>
	<p class="block_">“Billy,” Mama Robin told him, “this worm is big enough for all of you. Papa and I will keep looking, but it takes quite a long time to fly across the park and back. You children will just have to share this worm until we get back.”</p>
